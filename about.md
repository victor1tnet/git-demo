This is intended to be a play ground.

If you want to see your edits in the proper way, you must install and use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

Installing git:

* On windows: [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
* On linux `apt-get install git git-gui` or something similar on redhat, centos and such

We have not talked about [branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) even though they are very fundamental.

Notice that we have bith *master* and *gh-pages* branch. See [doc](https://pages.github.com/) for reasons.
